Today I'm starting the series of Spring-Security articles, and most of them will be references from web-sites and book named "Spring-Security" from authors Mick Knutson,Robert Winch and Peter Mularien. Before going into an example of Spring Security lets clarify why do we need spring security.

# Why do We Need Spring Security ?

The internet based hacking has been born with the internet itself and no need to go for detail history about it. They guys who has long experience of web development already seen many kinky ways of internet exploitations. They already have developed skills to stand against those attacks and when they develop something they can write the code that protects agains those attacks. But human factor still remains and developers may forget put the measurements against some existing attacks, then it repeats again. That is ok if the professional forgot to put some prevention code for specific attack, he can remember later and recode it. But what about newcomer, who has no idea about it, he should learn from seniors and it may take a years and years. That is why people started developing the frameworks, that are already contains those preventions by default. There are many such frameworks out there, and many more coming. Here we will talk about Spring Security, which is basically security framework that works and developed particularly to work with spring framework.
