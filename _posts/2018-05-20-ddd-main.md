## What is Domain Driven Design (DDD) ?

It is a software development approach used for complex needs, connecting the implementation to an evolving model of the core business concepts. It puts the focus on the problem domain and helps identify the architecture.


## Key Benefits of DDD

- **Business necessities oriented**: Developers communicate better with the business team and the work is more efficient
- **A Common set of terms used by entire team**: The language is linked to the domain model of the project
- **Better Code**: more readable and less duplication code
- **Agility**: clarifies the mental model of domain experts into a useful model for the business
- **Keep focus on the solution**: clean boundaries around pure models enables the developers to put their efforts on what matters the most. It enables them to focus on the solution


## Main Concepts

- **Ubiquitous Language**: Bridges the gap between developers and experts
- **Bounded Context**: Clear boundaries between different parts of the system
- **Core Domain**: Focus on the most important part of the system (refer to the existing solutions for not important part of the system)


## Layered Architecture

### Onion Architecture
This is the classical onion architecture, which refers that core part of the onion cannot refer to the upper layers and should be independent. While upper layers are relaying on lower layers (relaying core layer as well). Core elements of the model should act in an isolation from others.

Core part of the Onion would contain: Entities, Value Objects, Domain events and Aggregates. Next upper layer contains: Repositories, Factories and Domain Services. Application Services are located on higher level, and finally most highest layer contains UI.

### DDD Example

### Separation of Concerns
Core layer elements carry the most important part of the application, its business logic (*not all of it of course but most part*). Entity and Value Object should do only one thing which is representing a domain objects. They should not contain and knowledge about how theya are persisting in the repository. Cleaner we keep our domain model, easier it will be reason about it.

**Modeling Best Practices**
Development should be started from implementing Core Domain. Most of the case it is difficult and impossible to implement cored domain without having a data. So that is why most of the time developers try to start from impelementing repository part first to have some data. But It is possible to implement core domain first by using UnitTests. Starting from core domain would help later at repository design part too.
