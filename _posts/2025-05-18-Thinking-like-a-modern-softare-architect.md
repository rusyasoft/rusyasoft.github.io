In software development, writing clean code is only part of the equation. A software architect must rise above the code and think in terms of **systems, evolution, constraints, and trade-offs**. It's not just *how* something should be built—but *why*, *when*, and *to what extent*.

## A Good Architect Asks the Right Questions

Before designing or approving a feature, a thoughtful architect should assess it through a strategic lens. As **Luca Mezzalira** outlines in his talk, [Thinking Like an Architect](https://gitnation.com/contents/thinking-like-an-architect), these key questions help navigate design complexity:

- **What’s the rate of change of this feature?**  
  Will it evolve rapidly or remain relatively stable over time?

- **How will this feature evolve?**  
  Think beyond the immediate version. Will this eventually need to support new user types, scale horizontally, or interact with new systems?

- **How often have we changed it in the past 18 months?**  
  Historical change frequency is a strong predictor of future volatility.

- **What are the consequences of being too granular?**  
  Over-engineering and microservices sprawl can introduce unnecessary complexity and maintenance overhead.

- **What kind of traffic should this feature handle?**  
  Estimating expected load—both average and peak—guides performance considerations and scalability design.

- **Is this service latency-sensitive?**  
  Does it sit on a user-critical path (e.g., checkout, sign-in), or can it tolerate delays (e.g., analytics pipelines)?

## Strategic Depth: Additional Questions Architects Should Ask

Beyond the technical and evolutionary aspects, product and business alignment are crucial. Here are additional questions to deepen the context:

- **Where does this feature stand in our priority stack?**  
  Is this a foundational requirement or an experimental nice-to-have?

- **If priorities are unclear, how do we evaluate ROI?**  
  Assess Return on Investment based on expected impact vs. implementation and operational cost.

These questions ground decisions in business value rather than technical excitement alone.

## Product Alignment: Zooming into the “Why”

To anchor architecture into product goals, zoom in further with these guiding prompts:

- **Why is this feature important *now*?**  
  Urgency should be justified by market demands, stakeholder needs, or technical imperatives.

- **What KPIs are we aiming to improve?**  
  Tying work to measurable outcomes (e.g., conversion rate, retention, system uptime) brings clarity and accountability.

- **What is the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this feature?**  
  Identify the smallest valuable version that can go to production and provide learning.

- **What elements are absolutely mandatory vs. optional?**  
  Distinguish between *must-haves* and *nice-to-haves*—a critical habit to avoid scope creep.

## The Only Constants: **Change** and **Trade-Offs**

If there's one principle architects should internalize, it’s this:

> The only two constants in software architecture are **change** and **trade-offs**.

There is no perfect design. Only designs that are *good enough*—for now.

## Adopt a Lean, Evolving Mindset

The best architectural decisions:

- Are made **at the last responsible moment**, not prematurely
- **Balance risk vs. paralysis** — don't endlessly research or prototype when a timely decision is needed
- **Favor high-level clarity** early on (e.g., separation of domains, flow of data, boundaries of responsibility)
- **Delay specific tooling decisions** until real constraints emerge (e.g., use an abstraction before locking into Kafka or RabbitMQ)

> Architecture is not a fixed blueprint; it's a living organism. The art lies in knowing *when* to commit and *how* to evolve.

## Final Thoughts

Software architecture is not just about scalability and reliability—it’s about **contextual reasoning**, **product alignment**, and **adaptability**. Thinking like an architect means becoming a system-level thinker, a translator between business and technology, and a strategist who thrives on trade-offs—not just a coder who structures classes.

> Architecting is not a title. It’s a way of thinking.
