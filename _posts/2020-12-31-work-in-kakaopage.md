I would like to share my work experience at Kakaopage (Korea) as a developer. It is one of the top Software Companies in Korea and very good place to work as a developer (<-- for TL;DRs)

# Little Introduction
Before talking about [KakaoPage](https://www.kakaocorp.com/service/KakaoPage?lang=en), let me give you some introduction about it. It is a subsidiary company of [Kakao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakao) which is considered as one of the top and succeded companies in Korea. Kakao has started as a chatting service company around 2010, their product named KakaoTalk. It is still number one messaging company in Korea and almost everyone who has a smartphone in Korea use KakaoTalk. KakaoPage is a content service, where you can find webtoons, comics and VOD. They have applied very genious model of earning user and money, by providing a user a choice. Lets say you choose some webtoon and start watching the episodes. Either You watch one episode today and watch another tomorrow or pay now and watch as much as you want. Right from that point it boils down to the quality of webtoon, because belive me if the content is good you will pay without noticing yourself. In some sense it is fair, because you are paying for the content you really desire to watch. 

# Interview
I have applied to KakaoPage through an app called Wanted (recently this app has become really popular in Korea). They have selected me for the interview process and of course first of all they have sent me an online coding test. Which was around 4 questions at codility (now I think they have changed the testing system) and 3 hours were given. First two questions are easy ones, but last two questions would take a quite a bit of time.

After passing online coding test there were two on-site interviews. First on-site interview was with a developers and TeamLead from the team where I was applying for. There were four interviewers, they have introduced themselves and started talking in a very friendly manner. They have asked all sort's of questions from my past experiences, and some of interviewers were asking me other kind of technical questions regarding the Backend. Important to notice all interview was in Korean, even though they have allowed me to speak-out in English whenever I want.

On the second on-site interview there were three interviewers: Head of the department (Global Deparment), CTO and HR. CTO has asked me about my past projects in previous companies. Head of Deparment asked me more about organizational stuffs, especially how do I think about Monolith and Microservices. HR guy boiled me with a behavioral questions, but they were reasonable. Because one of the HR's main task is to guard the company from obvious A... HOLES :)

# First Impression
Company provides welcome gift box to new arrivals. Yeah receiving a gift box is always good.

Internal environment of the company very good. You can feel some professional designers put an effort to make it look good. The impression still left from the Kakaopage is that High level of Brightness. It was very bright all over the company, yeah they put some effort in lights too.

It is important to say that company provided the lunch money 150'000 KWON per month, and if you don't use it this month it would accumulate for the next month. If you stay for a dinner you could apply for another 6000 KWON per day. But almost nobody stayed, people would go home early or on time.

By the way, the working hours are flexible, only keep the core time (from 11am to 4pm). Other than that You can choose your working hours. Just make it sure it accumulates to required hours at the end of the month. I had no problem with that at all.

# Culture
Everyone has a nickname and we refer through the nick name. Without adding any Mr or Ms in front of it and also without adding nim at the end of the names (님 is addition you have to add at the end of the name in order to show some respect in Korean culture).

People around me were very kind, friendly and respectful. Kakaopage uses slack and most of the conversations would happen there. There were work groups where only work stuffs are discussed. Playground channels were for sharing anything about anything, that was very fun. Even though I didn't share much but You could learn some good news from there.

Before the COVID-19 hit, there were gatherings to have a meal. In Korea they call it Hyeshik(회식), and here it was very much different from my previous companies. Usually in Korea if they call for hyeshik(회식), it means you gotta gather with you team mates and select some restaurant and go for it. But here in Kakaopage you had a freedom how you want to spend your Hyeshik(회식)money for this month. There was a channel in a slack for Hyeshik(회식) and people would just gather there and go for dining. So you could go to hyeshik(회식) with people you have never talked to and become a close to them. That was a real unique experience I had and really never heard of any Korean company with a such a culture.

Sex equality is also very much respected in this company. I heard some guy employee tried to approach a woman in a non-manner disrespect way. Not sure what exactly happened there, but the HR commitee has decided it was a sexual harassment and eliminated the guy from the company. 

Once a year every employee had to complete an online courses on topics: 
- Gender Equality
- Disablity Equality
- Privacy and Security in Organization

# My Team
I have been working at Global Kakaopage team, which had a projects that are oriented to launch the Kakaopage service in a foreign countries. At my arrival to Kakaopage they have launched the Kakaopage Indonesia service and during my stay I was part of the team who developed additional features and kept the service alive. 

There was no infrastructure team, so we have used AWS cloud. Since we didn't have an infrastructure experts our leaders allowed us to use Managed Service from AWS. If you have any familiarity with aws then you must know using Managed AWS Services quite expensive but worth of your time. I'm not sure am I allowed to talk details about the dev stack here, but for the sake of privacy better not. But I can tell for sure team-leader was a great guy, I have learned a lot of things from him. Originally he was a mathematician and damn its really good to work with people who has mathematical thinking. The conversation is always optimized and very smooth. Even though Korean is not my mother tongue, he could understand me very well and I could understand him clearly. Other members of the team were similarly smart and insightfull.

# HR-Team
HR(Human Resource) people were very professional and friendly. They work very hard and ready for call, as I know they have worked from company even in the worst situations of covid pandemic. They have been respectfull even to the people who was leaving the company. That would require a lot of courage I guess :)

# Conclusion
As a conclusion my experience at Kakaopage was very positive. That is the company where developers can have a long and happy live. By learning new things everyday and receiving one of the great wellfare companies can provide. As I have mentioned above the team members and leaders were very smart and friendly. Sometimes I have wondered why is that everything goes so well and smooth. Yeah I was very much surprised that couldn't see any irritating people around.
